<h2>What is Javascript?</h2>

<h4>Javascript is a core coding language in the World Wide Web, along with HTML and CSS. Around 98% of websites use Javascript to focus on the webpage behaviour aspects.</h4>


<h2>Why is Javascript so important?</h2>

<h4>Javascript is essential in all internet experiences. It is able to create more interaction and complexity into their applications. Search engines, ecommerce, content management systems, responsive design, social media and phone apps would not be possible features without Javascript.</h4>

<h2>Can Javascript be used in more ways than webpage building?</h2>

<h4>Yes, Javascript can be used in more ways that do not include webpages. Javascript does also play a role in databases and other content management systems. Although, a less popular use of Javascript would be game design. The vast majority of games which do use Javascript are web based games, a massive exception to this however being the hit game Minecraft.</h4>
