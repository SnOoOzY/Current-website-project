<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<h4>HTML is the most popular language of choice for building the contents within websites. Another part of HTML is CSS, another language used for styling the contents created in HTML.</h4>


<h2>Why is HTML so important?</h2>

<h4>HTML is so important because it is the most popular and useful language for building websites from scratch. 94.8% of all websites use HTML as their core language. HTML only mainly focuses on contents in a website, like text, images, links, etc.</h4>

<h2>Can HTML be used in more ways than webpage building?</h2>

<h4>Not entirely, as HTML can only work when it's connected with a web browser, as it's only purpose is to tell the browser what to do. You are able to program things like very simple web games, but it is not the most useful language for that job.</h4>
